A [***botnet***](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/) refers to a group of computers which have been ***infected by malware*** and have come under the control of a malicious actor. The term botnet is a portmanteau from the words robot and network and each infected device is called a bot.
